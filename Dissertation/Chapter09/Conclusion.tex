\section{Conclusion}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In conclusion machine learning algorithms already power large parts of our
digital lives. This is driven by data hungry learning models with potentially
billions of parameters. However now so much data is being produced that it is no
longer viable to centralise the data, leading to the need for efficient machine
learning on-device and communication between devices to improve the model. I
have introduced a new machine learning paradigm that should be more power
efficient than existing frameworks on low power devices over a local network. I
have displayed and explained the relevant research in distributed machine
learning and related fields, as well as core machine learning and neural
networking concepts. I have also shown the project timeline of building the new
framework, my testing methodology and how I will control risk within my project.
