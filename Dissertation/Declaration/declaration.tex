This work has not been previously accepted in substance for any degree and is

the result of my own investigations, except where otherwise stated. Other
sources are acknowledged by footnotes giving explicit references. A bibliography
is appended. I hereby give my consent for my thesis, if accepted, to be made
available for photocopying and inter-library loan, and for the title and summary
to be made available to outside organisations.
